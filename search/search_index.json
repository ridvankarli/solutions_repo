Motivation Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics with applications in sports, engineering, and astrophysics. This study explores how the range of a projectile depends on the angle of projection. 2. Key Equations Equations of Motion Horizontal position: $ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $ Vertical position: $ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $ Time of Flight \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Maximum Height \\[ H = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin(\\theta))^2}{2g} \\] Horizontal Range \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] The maximum range occurs at: $$ \\theta = 45^\\circ $$ 3. Range Analysis Angle Effect : Range is maximized at \\( 45^\\circ \\) and symmetric around it. Initial Velocity : Range increases quadratically with \\( v_0 \\) . Gravity : Higher \\( g \\) reduces the range. 4. Applications Sports : Optimizing throw angles in games. Engineering : Ballistic trajectory predictions. Space Science : Rocket launch calculations. 5. Python Simulation import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def projectile_range(v0, theta, g=9.81): theta_rad = np.radians(theta) return (v0 ** 2) * np.sin(2 * theta_rad) / g v0 = 20 # m/s theta_values = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) ranges = [projectile_range(v0, theta) for theta in theta_values] plt.plot(theta_values, ranges) plt.xlabel('Angle (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (m)') plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Angle') plt.grid() plt.show() 6. Results & Discussion The simulation confirms that range is maximized at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . The relationship is symmetric, meaning \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) yield the same range. Limitations No air resistance, wind, or uneven terrain considered. Extensions Adding drag forces for real-world accuracy. Studying projectile motion in different gravity environments. 7. Conclusion Projectile range depends on the angle, velocity, and gravity. While an idealized model is useful, real-world conditions require further refinement.","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-motivation","text":"Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics with applications in sports, engineering, and astrophysics.
