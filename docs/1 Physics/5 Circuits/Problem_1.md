# Problem 1
# Calculating Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## 1. Introduction

Electrical circuit analysis often requires calculating the equivalent resistance between two points in a network of resistors. While traditional methods like series and parallel combinations work well for simple circuits, they become cumbersome for complex networks. This document explores how graph theory provides an elegant solution to this problem, enabling systematic analysis of arbitrary resistor networks.

We will implement a full algorithm (Option 2) that calculates the equivalent resistance of complex circuits by representing them as graphs and applying graph reduction techniques.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Circuit as a Graph

An electrical circuit can be represented as a graph where:
- Nodes (vertices) represent junctions or connection points
- Edges represent resistors
- Edge weights correspond to resistance values

For a circuit with two terminals (input and output), the equivalent resistance is the effective resistance between these two terminals when the circuit is viewed as a single resistor.

### 2.2 Equivalent Resistance Calculation Methods

Several methods exist for calculating equivalent resistance in a graph:

1. **Series-Parallel Reduction**: Iteratively identify series and parallel connections and reduce them
2. **Node Elimination (Y-Δ Transformation)**: Systematically eliminate internal nodes
3. **Matrix-Based Methods**: Use conductance matrices to solve for equivalent resistance

Our implementation will focus on the first two methods, combining series-parallel reduction with Y-Δ transformations for circuits that cannot be reduced using simple series-parallel rules.

## 3. Algorithm Implementation

Our implementation uses Python with the NetworkX library for graph manipulation. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Represent the circuit as a weighted graph
2. Iteratively apply series and parallel reductions where possible
3. When no more series-parallel reductions are possible, apply Y-Δ transformations
4. Continue until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the terminal nodes

### 3.2 Algorithm Explanation

The implementation follows these key steps:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Create a graph where edges represent resistors with resistance values as weights
   - Identify source and target nodes (the terminals between which we want to calculate equivalent resistance)

2. **Series Reduction**:
   - Identify nodes with exactly two connections (except terminals)
   - Replace the node and its two connected edges with a single edge with resistance equal to the sum of the original resistances

3. **Parallel Reduction**:
   - Identify pairs of nodes connected by multiple edges
   - Replace the multiple edges with a single edge with resistance equal to the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals of the original resistances

4. **Y-Δ Transformation**:
   - When no more series or parallel reductions are possible, identify nodes with exactly three connections
   - Transform Y-configurations (star) into Δ-configurations (delta) using the transformation formulas

5. **Matrix Method (Fallback)**:
   - If the graph cannot be fully reduced using the above methods, use the admittance matrix approach
   - Construct the conductance matrix, apply boundary conditions, and solve the resulting system of equations

## 4. Test Cases and Analysis

### 4.1 Test Case 1: Simple Series Circuit

Consider a simple series circuit with two resistors:
```
A--3Ω--B--5Ω--C
```

**Expected Result**: The equivalent resistance should be 3Ω + 5Ω = 8Ω.

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. Identify that node B is in series (has exactly two connections)
2. Replace the two edges with a single edge with resistance 8Ω
3. The resulting circuit is a single resistor between A and C

**Result**: The algorithm correctly calculates 8Ω as the equivalent resistance.

### 4.2 Test Case 2: Simple Parallel Circuit

Consider a simple parallel circuit with two resistors:
```
A--10Ω--B
|        |
--20Ω----
```

**Expected Result**: The equivalent resistance should be (10Ω × 20Ω) / (10Ω + 20Ω) = 6.67Ω.

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. Identify that nodes A and B are connected by multiple edges (parallel connection)
2. Calculate the equivalent resistance as 1 / (1/10 + 1/20) = 6.67Ω
3. Replace the parallel edges with a single edge

**Result**: The algorithm correctly calculates 6.67Ω as the equivalent resistance.

## 6. Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates how graph theory can be effectively applied to calculate the equivalent resistance of complex electrical circuits. By representing circuits as graphs and applying systematic reduction techniques, we can handle arbitrary circuit configurations that would be difficult to analyze using traditional methods.

The algorithm successfully handles:
- Simple series and parallel combinations
- Nested configurations through iterative reduction
- Complex circuits with multiple cycles using Y-Δ transformations and matrix methods

Graph theory provides a powerful framework for circuit analysis, allowing for algorithmic approaches that can be automated and scaled to handle complex networks. This implementation serves as a foundation that can be extended to support more advanced circuit analysis tasks, including time-varying circuits, non-linear elements, and distributed parameter systems.
